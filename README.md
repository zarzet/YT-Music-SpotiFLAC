# YT‑Music‑SpotiFLAC

<img src="icon-proj.png" width="256" />

A compact, high‑performance SpotiFLAC extension that integrates YouTube Music as a metadata and search source. It provides reliable search results, robust metadata matching, and is designed as a metadata‑only provider so SpotiFLAC can use other providers for downloads.
